# Fake-news-Detector

Project Description: 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify news articles 
as either fake or real. The system will analyze the textual content, metadata, 
and source information of news articles to predict their authenticity. The 
project involves building a machine learning pipeline that includes 
preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The model 
will be deployed as a web application with real-time news classification 
capabilities. 
Technology Used: 
• Programming Language: Python 
• Libraries/Frameworks: 
o scikit-learn (for traditional machine learning models) 
o TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models) 
o NLTK (for NLP preprocessing) 
o Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation) 
o Flask/Django (for web deployment) 
• Cloud Deployment: AWS/GCP/Azure 
• Other Tools: Grid search for hyperparameter tuning, RESTful API 
integration, and cloud-based solutions for deployment 
Features: 
1. Text Features: 
o Article text (full content) 
o Title, author, and publication date of the article 
o Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization for 
text analysis 
o Vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF or bag-of-words 
2. Metadata Features: 
o Source information (website, social media platform) 
o Article length, number of unique words, readability score 
3. Additional Features: 
o Sentiment analysis (positive/negative tone of the article) 
o Text similarity analysis (comparison with verified sources) 
o Named entity recognition (NER) to identify critical entities in the 
article 
o Social network analysis (if available) for fake news spreading 
patterns 
4. Handling Imbalance: 
o Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
Technique) to balance the dataset 
5. Multimodal Features (Optional): 
o Image or video content associated with the article 
o Image classification for fake content (if required) 
Outcomes: 
1. Model Performance: 
o Achieve high classification accuracy (target: 95%) 
o Precision and recall for identifying fake news with a balanced F1
score (target: 0.9) 
o ROC-AUC score indicating good separation between fake and real 
news (target: 0.95) 
2. Deployed Application: 
o A fully functional web interface where users can input news 
articles for real-time fake news classification 
o RESTful API for integration with other applications or platforms 
3. Data Visualization: 
o Confusion matrix to visualize true/false positives and negatives 
o ROC curve and precision-recall curves to assess the model’s 
effectiveness 
o Feature importance plots (for non-deep learning models) 
4. Scalable System: 
o A cloud-deployed model capable of handling a large volume of 
news articles 
o Integration of multimodal detection for future enhancement (e.g., 
text + image analysis) 
5. Comprehensive Technical Report: 
o Detailed documentation covering data preprocessing, model 
training, evaluation, and deployment steps
